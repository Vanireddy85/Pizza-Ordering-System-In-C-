About Project
Pizza Ordering System project is a desktop application developed using C# Language. The Project is based on a concept to maintain all the pizza orders for delivery of a pizza house. Talking about the system, a user can order pizza from the main menu by selecting the Pizza size, crust, extra toppings, drinks and other items. Each of the selected items contains a different price. After placing orders he/she has to check their order list and confirm their orders for payments.

Talking about the Payment procedures, the user has to provide customer’s information which includes First name, Last name, Address, Province, City, Postal Code, Contact number and email. Except for contact numbers and email all the field are required to be fulfilled. Then the user has to provide Payment Information which includes Payment Method, Card Number and Amount paid by the customer. Each field is required here. Payment method includes Cash, Debit, Credit card and the card number field depends upon the Payment method, meaning whenever the user select cash option, the field gets disabled and in terms of card payment method the field gets visible and can be filled. After entering the amount paid by the customer, the system calculates the Amount due automatically and previews in the system. After this, the order gets submitted.

Pizza Ordering System project helps in order management of a Pizza house within a short period of time. This desktop application project can be used for pizza delivery too and it’s easy to operate and understood by the users.
